            Water (chemical formula H2O) is an inorganic, transparent,
            tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance, which
            is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all
            known living organisms (in which it acts as a solvent[1]). It is
            vital for all known forms of life, despite providing neither food,
            energy, nor organic micronutrients. Its chemical formula, H2O,
            indicates that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two
            hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds. The hydrogen atoms are
            attached to the oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45Â°.[2] "Water" is
